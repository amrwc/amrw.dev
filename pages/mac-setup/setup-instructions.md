# Mac Setup

## Quick steps

1. Open Terminal.
1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).

   ```console
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
   ```

1. Install prerequisites.

   ```console
   brew install git nvm
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

1. Install Node.

   ```console
   mkdir ~/.nvm

   # Find latest long-term service branch from the list
   nvm ls-remote

   # Install the LTS
   nvm install --lts=Fermium
   ```

1. Get the repository with dotfiles.

   ```console
   git clone https://github.com/amrwc/amrwc.github.io.git
   ```

1. Symlink dotfiles to the repository (the script uses Node).

   ```console
   cd amrwc.github.io
   ./scripts/dotfiles/link/link_all
   ```

1. Install [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org) to avoid
   further frustration about key mapping.

   ```console
   brew cask install karabiner-elements
   ```

   In case you encounter problems with installing the virtual keyboard/mouse
   driver, as instructed in the app (as of `13.1.0`), the latest known version
   to work flawlessly is `12.10.0` (the disk image
   [can be found on GitHub](https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-Elements/releases/tag/v12.10.0)).

1. [Change default shell](https://stackoverflow.com/a/26321141/10620237) from
   `Bash` to `Zsh`.

   ```bash
   chsh -s /bin/zsh
   # Alternatively:
   chsh -s "$(which zsh)"
   ```

1. Install `Oh My Zsh`.

   ```console
   sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
   ```

1. Install remaining applications.

   ```console
   brew install autojump gpg pandoc thefuck the_silver_searcher zsh
   brew cask install 1password firefox flux iterm2 slack visual-studio-code
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

##Â Less important

1. Set f.lux preferences.

- Location: use the current city.
- Daytime: full brightness (Normal (Daylight)).
- Sunset: 3400K (Halogen).
- Bedtime: 1600K.
- In the dropdown from the menu bar:
  - Options:
    - Fast transitions enabled.
    - Notifications from f.lux website disabled.
    - Backwards alarm clock disabled.
  - Color effects:
    - OS X Dark theme at sunset.

1. Turn on English spell-checking in `Spell Right` in VS Code â€“Â press the 'dot
   with halo' icon in the bottom-right corner and choose the language from the
   list.

## Git

- [create and add an SSH key to the account](https://help.github.com/en/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
  â€“ this enables to push to private repositories without providing credentials
  every time,
- set up GnuPG â€“ it's used for
  [verifying the identity of the commiter (signing commits)](https://help.github.com/en/articles/managing-commit-signature-verification)

  <https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-gpg-key>

  ```console
  # Installs GnuPG
  brew install gpg pinentry-mac

  # Starts an interactive setup
  gpg --full-generate-key

  # Lists the local gpg keys â€“Â copy the right ssb
  # (the part after 'rsa4096/')
  gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG

  # Exports the GPG key â€“Â copy-paste it to GitHub/GitLab/whatever
  gpg --armor --export <the_ssb_from_above>

  # Arms Git with the signing key
  git config --global user.signingkey <the_ssb_from_above>

  # These two are necessary for GitHub and others
  # to properly recognise the signature
  # The email looks like the following:
  # 01231230+username@users.noreply.github.com
  git config --global user.email "your.github.or.gitlab@email.address"
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"

  # This tells Git to always sign the local commits
  git config --global commit.gpgSign true
  ```

## System Preferences

### iCloud

- Sign in to iCloud. Ask the employer whether you should use a company-provided
  account, make a new one with the company's email, or just use whatever you
  prefer. It's definitely nice to be able to sync notes, reminders, and
  calendars between the computer and phone.

### Apple ID

This item appears after you've signed in to iCloud.

- iCloud
  - Uncheck 'News'.
  - Uncheck 'Home'.
- Verify devices list and remove any that should no longer be there.

### General

- Appearance: Auto.
- Default web browser: Firefox.app.
- Check 'Ask to keep changes when closing documents'.
- Recent items: None. (This is the menu available via the Apple icon in
  top-left corner.)

### Dock

- Check 'Automatically hide and show the Dock'.
- Uncheck 'Show recent applications in Dock'.

    - Spreadsheets

  - Add any directories that take lots of space, and may be the reason for
    slower results, such as `node_modules`.

### Notifications

Adjust notification settings for individual applications.

### Language & Region

Just make sure these settings won't cause any confusion.

### Touch ID

Set it up to unlock your Mac with it. Currently, there are only 3 fingerprints
slots, so it may get tricky as you can't, for instance, use both index fingers
and both thumbs. Unless... ðŸ˜³

<https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/270229>

Basically, alternate fingers while you register them. This way, more than one
finger can get saved into one memory slot. Of course, the accuracy goes down,
but for two fingers in each slot it works quite well.

### Users & Groups

- Login Items
  - Make sure the items make sense and that no redundant apps launch at login.

### Security & Privacy

- General
  - Require password `immediately` after sleep or screen saver begins.
- FileVault
  - It requires an iCloud account as a backup option, or else it will return a
    recovery key that has to be saved somewhere.
  - It's actually a quick process when the disk isn't full.
- Firewall
  - Ask the employer for details.
- Privacy
  - Location Services
    - Uncheck 'Enable Location Services'.
  - Advertising
    - Check 'Limit Ad Tracking'.
  - Analytics and Improvements
    - Uncheck all.

    preferences'.

- Advanced...
  - Only leave 'Check for updates' checked.

### Network

- Wi-Fi
  - Advanced...
    - DNS
      - DNS Servers
        - Add `1.1.1.1`.
        - Press OK.
        - Press Apply to save the settings.
- Thunderbolt Bridge
  - Advanced...
    - DNS
      - DNS Servers
        - Add `1.1.1.1`.

      ```console
      defaults write NSGlobalDomain KeyRepeat -int 2
      ```
  - Delay Until Repeat
    - Put the slider in the fastest possible position.
      ```console
      defaults write NSGlobalDomain InitialKeyRepeat -int 15
      ```
  - Check 'Adjust keyboard brightness in low light'.
  - Check 'Turn keyboard backlight off after `10 secs` of inactivity.
  - Touch Bar shows `Expanded Control Strip`.
  - Customise Control Strip...
    - Put these items in the following order:
      - Brightness
      - Quick Actions
      - Keyboard Brightness
      - Space
      - Media
      - Volume
- Text
  - Uncheck
    - 'Correct spelling automatically'
    - 'Capitalise words automatically'
    - 'Add full stop with double-space'
    - 'Use smart quotes and dashes'
- Shortcuts
  - Input Sources
    - Uncheck both input source navigation options as to avoid accidentally
      changing keyboard layout.
  - Check 'Use keyboard navigation to move focus between controls'.
  - App Shortcuts
    - Override `Quit <app_name>` with `cmd + Q` behaviour of the system by
      adding shortcuts here. `Menu Title` would be, for instance, 'Quit
      Safari'. The spelling must, of course, be correct. `Keyboard Shortcut` is
      whatever combination of keys you want; use `cmd + option + Q`. For
      example:
      - Application: `Firefox.app`
      - Menu title: `Quit Firefox`
      - Keyboard shortcut: `cmd + option + Q`
- Input Sources

  defaults write .GlobalPreferences com.apple.mouse.scaling -1
  ```

  The above may no longer work, according to some threads on Ask Different:

  - <https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/333989/365339>
  - <https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/251456/365339>

  Though, I suspect they didn't restart the machine after they made the change.

  Since I use a SteelSeries mouse, I suppose it doesn't affect me much as I use
  their driver.

  Could also try the
  [ExactMouse tool](https://downloads.steelseriescdn.com/drivers/tools/steelseries-exactmouse-tool.dmg)
  from SteelSeries â€“Â some comments claim that it works with any mouse, not just
  SteelSeries's.
